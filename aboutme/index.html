    <h2>Johanna Samahiya</h2>
    <h2>Jo</h2>
    <p>I live in Windhoek Namibia. I was born in Budapest, Hungary 
        and lived there with my mother for the first 6 years of my life. Magyar is the first
        language I spoke.  Later after moving to Africa, I forgot all of magyar and learned English
        and my african tribes' language.  I am not fluent in either one of them.</p>  
        <p>I worked for the World Food Programme as a finance officer, as well as for the Global Fund
        as a Finance Manager. In these positions I managed a lot of money and lead lots of people.
        I however felt I needed to take care of my children more, and left my work eight years ago.</p>
        <p>With all these years of staying at home, I became an expert in cooking, changing diapers,
        motivating others, teaching, giving emotional support, being a good example, collaboration,
        team work, playing at the play park,driving, negotiating, being peacemaker and or mediator
        and running up and down with doctors and hospitals at odd hours.  Now I just want to
        do web development.</p>
